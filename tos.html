            <p class="tos-updated">Last Updated: December 11, 2025</p>

            <div class="tos-content">
                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using FortyX's investment platform ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Service.</p>

                <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                <p>You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into binding contracts to use our Service. By using FortyX, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements.</p>

                <h2>3. Investment Services</h2>
                <h3>3.1 Service Description</h3>
                <p>FortyX provides managed digital asset investment services through a private broker system. All investment activities are conducted through our Discord-based ticket system.</p>

                <h3>3.2 Principal Protection</h3>
                <p>FortyX guarantees 100% protection of your original investment principal. This means you will always retain the full amount of your initial deposit, regardless of market conditions. This guarantee applies to the original investment amount only and does not cover potential profits or losses from investment performance.</p>

                <h3>3.3 Profit Sharing</h3>
                <p>Investment profits are shared according to our tiered system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tier 1 (Starter):</strong> 60% to investor, 40% to FortyX</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 2 (Growth):</strong> 80% to investor, 20% to FortyX</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 3 (Elite):</strong> 90% to investor, 10% to FortyX</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your tier is determined by your portfolio size and investment history with FortyX.</p>

                <h2>4. Account Management</h2>
                <h3>4.1 Discord Account</h3>
                <p>All transactions and communications are conducted through Discord. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Discord account and any activities conducted through it.</p>

                <h3>4.2 Deposits and Withdrawals</h3>
                <p>All deposits and withdrawals must be initiated through our Discord ticket system. We support Ethereum, PulseChain, Solana, and other specified blockchain networks. Minimum and maximum investment amounts may vary.</p>

                <h3>4.3 Privacy Technology</h3>
                <p>Your funds are dispersed across multiple wallets using privacy-preserving technology similar to Tornado Cash to ensure blockchain anonymity. This is part of our commitment to protecting your financial privacy.</p>

                <h2>5. Investment Risks</h2>
                <h3>5.1 Market Volatility</h3>
                <p>Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and unpredictable. While your principal is protected, investment returns are not guaranteed and may fluctuate significantly.</p>

                <h3>5.2 Regulatory Risk</h3>
                <p>Digital asset regulations vary by jurisdiction and are subject to change. You are responsible for understanding and complying with laws in your jurisdiction.</p>

                <h3>5.3 Technology Risk</h3>
                <p>Blockchain technology and smart contracts carry inherent risks including network failures, security vulnerabilities, and technical errors.</p>

                <h3>5.4 No Financial Advice</h3>
                <p>FortyX provides investment management services but does not provide financial advice. All information provided is for educational purposes only. You should conduct your own research and consult with qualified financial advisors before investing.</p>

                <h2>6. Prohibited Activities</h2>
                <p>You agree not to:</p>

                <h2>8. Withdrawal Policy</h2>
                <p>You may request withdrawal of your funds at any time through the Discord ticket system. While FortyX is designed for long-term investment, we do not impose lock-up periods. However, early withdrawal may result in missing potential future gains.</p>
